## 📸 Screenshots

### Speed toolbar + mouse speed control locked on at 1.70x
The wheel-click mouse speed control tunes the video continuously while the closest preset (`1.75x`) lights up as an approximate indicator.

### Single-tap speed toolbar with live active indicator
The 1x–4x speed bar sits directly below the URL bar. The active speed glows in Brave Orange, both in the browser toolbar and inside the YouTube player.

## ✨ Features

- **🖱️ Continuous Mouse Speed Control (New)**:
  - **Wheel-click (middle-click) to lock on / off** while a video is playing.
  - Move the mouse **right to speed up** and **left to slow down** across a fully continuous **1x → 4x** range — no fixed steps, up to 0.01x precision.
  - Only the playback rate changes — the playhead is never touched or seeked.
  - The nearest preset button in the toolbar lights up as an approximate indicator (e.g. `1.70x` → `1.75x`).
  - **Hold `Ctrl`** to temporarily use the mouse normally (open links in a new tab, click, scroll) without leaving the lock mode.
  - Mouse wheel **scrolling keeps working normally**; only the wheel *click* is reserved while locked.
- **⚡ Linear Single-Tap Speed Toolbar (0.75x to 4x)**:
  - Instant one-tap speed buttons located directly below the URL bar: `0.75x`, `1x`, `1.25x`, `1.5x`, `1.75x`, `2x`, `2.25x`, `2.5x`, `2.75x`, `3x`, `3.5x`, `4x`.
  - Live active indicator: the closest speed glows in Brave Orange (`#fb542b`).
  - Extended keyboard shortcuts (`Shift + >` and `Shift + <`) scale smoothly up to **4x**.
  - Smooth audio pitch preservation (`preservesPitch = true`) keeping voices clear and natural.
  - Speed memory: remembers your preferred playback speed across sessions.
- **📱 Bravest for Android (v1.2.0)**:
  - Compact **speed selection bar on top**, directly below the URL space, matching the desktop web app.
  - Prominent **drag-and-hold speed bubble** (pulsing globule animation) docked between the *next* and *Brave Search* buttons.
  - Tap and hold the bubble, drag your finger anywhere on screen: **right = faster, left = slower**, fully continuous **1x → 4x**.
  - Release to deactivate and resume normal controls; the nearest top-bar preset lights up as the approximate indicator.
  - Full-screen live speed readout, haptic feedback, ad-skipping and background audio playback.
- **🦁 Full Brave Shields Engine**:
  - Blocks banner ads, tracking scripts, and popups.
  - Automatically strips YouTube video ads (pre-rolls and mid-rolls).
  - Real-time tracker & ad blocked counter in the Omnibox.
- **🪟 Windows Aero Snap & Window Management**:
  - Drag the browser window smoothly from anywhere across the titlebar.
  - Full Windows Aero Snap support: drag to top to maximize, drag to left/right screen edges to snap and pin side-by-side.
  - Double-click titlebar to toggle maximize and restore.
  - Standard edge and corner resizing with dynamic maximize/restore icon toggle.
- **🌐 Brave UI & Aesthetics**:
  - Modern Brave dark theme with orange accents and glassmorphism.
  - Multi-tab management with draggable tabs and fast keyboard navigation.
  - Omnibox with Brave Search integration.
  - Pop-ups requested by pages (middle-click / `target="_blank"`) open as **tabs in the same window**.
